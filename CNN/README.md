# Implementing Convolutional Neural Network from scratch

## Background
Train a CNN network on CIFAR-10 dataset from scratch(using numpy).
Given true weights of the network, the task was to train a network from scratch to minimize the l2 loss between feature maps obtained using true weights and trained weights.

## Experiment
- Loaded the data(images) 
- Initialized weights from gaussian distribution
- Trained a single layer CNN network with padding/strides/dilation
- Computed L2 loss between feature map obtained from true weights and trained weights
